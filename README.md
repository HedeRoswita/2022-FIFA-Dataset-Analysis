    FIFA, also known as the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, is the global governing body of football (soccer) and is responsible for organizing and overseeing international football competitions. Founded in 1904, FIFA's mission is to promote and develop the sport of football worldwide, fostering fair play, teamwork, and sportsmanship. With a membership of 211 national football associations, FIFA plays a crucial role in shaping the sport's rules and regulations, ensuring the integrity of competitions, and striving to promote football's values and positive impact on communities.
    This project aims to achieve two primary objectives: performing meticulous data cleaning on a messy dataset and conducting an in-depth analysis of the performance of football players who have joined FIFA. The dataset, being inherently untidy, requires a robust data cleaning process to rectify inconsistencies, missing values, and errors, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the subsequent analysis. By employing various data cleaning techniques and preprocessing steps, we seek to transform the raw and disorganized data into a coherent and structured form suitable for analysis. Once the dataset is cleansed and prepared, we will delve into the world of football player statistics, exploring key performance indicators such as overall ratings, wages, values, and nationalities. Through data visualization , we aim to uncover insights, patterns, and trends in the data, shedding light on the factors influencing the performance of football players in FIFA. By accomplishing these objectives, this project strives to provide valuable and meaningful information for football enthusiasts, analysts, and decision-makers in the sports industry.
